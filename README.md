# datafun-05-sql-project
This project integrates Python and SQLite3 software into this project. The main focus will be on database interactions using SQLite. It will introduce logging, a useful tool for debugging and monitoring projects, and involves creating and managing a database, building a schema, and performing various SQL operations, including queries with joins, filters, and aggregations.
It includes a default Readme. md and a .gitignore for Python. 
I cloned the respiratory down to my machine using VScode.  I used Venv to create a new . venv environment and activated the environment. I also imported from the Python library pandas and sparrow. I used Markdown for my title. Git/add/commit and push were used to update the project in GitHub.  Also, a clickable link was provided to view this repo.
